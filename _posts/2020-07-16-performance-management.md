Each organisation that want to grow people or keep track of performance should use a framework. That is what performance management is about. It is a model/framework to be used managing by objectives and it consists of three parts

1. Objective settings
2. Managing performance
3. Review of objectives

Let's go a bit deeper for each.

## Objective settings
In order to track performance you need to know what you are aiming for. The company/department/team KPI can always be used to say that these will be improved by X percentage. The vision and mission statement on either level in the organisation (yes, there should be a vision and mission statement on each level in the organisation...) can also be used to find out what is the long-term goal for the company/department/team.

Objectives can also be pushed down from the executive level. Preferably you will go to your team and together with them develop the objectives and goals that you will track your employees against. If you do this with the team you will gain a better commitment for the goals since the team was part of creating them. It will be *their goals* as much as your goals. If the goals are created for them without their input it will not be their goals and you cannot expect the team to be as committed to the goals as you want.

In the one to ones with your team members you start from the team goals and together figure out what the employee can do individually towards these goals that should be part of that individuals goals.

The most important thing is that all goals on all levels are aligned. Individual goals should align with team goals. Team goals need to align with department goals. Department goals needs to align with etc. etc. I think you get it. Why is this important you might ask. Look at the picture below, which company would you like to be in?

By looking at the above image I know what I am striving for at least...

It is very important as a manager to care about the employees career growth. If they feel they have stagnated then it will not be long until they start looking for other opportunities in other companies. The career conversation should not happen all at once. It should be considered as a process. Where there are four main areas to dig into. However, You need to start at number 1. Then from there you can go in different directions

The following series is a way to learn about their past, gain insights in their future and understand their present. 

## Notes
When adding the agenda to the meeting invite then do not add the indented bullet points. These bullet points are for you to do follow up questions on the question at hand and dig deeper. 

Make sure to take note in order to keep track on what has been said and different action items.

## Purpose Of First Meeting 
The idea with this agenda is to get to know the person better. What is most important for them how they got into the job and what they consider to be their strengths. Also to gain a better understanding of their challenges today and to establish how often they want to meet with you.
 
### Agenda for the 1-1

3. What is most important for you professionally?
4. What challenges are you facing today?
5. Is there anything that I can help you with or do you need anything from me?

## Purpose Of Second Meeting
The idea with this agenda is to know about how they picture their future. To get to know their dreams. To understand where they want to be at the peak of their career. So this is about making them think about the topic and to do some self discovery. We should then make them a little more tangible. Something to keep in mind is that their path can always be altered. Nothing is ever set in stone. If they realise that they are on the wrong path then help them to take the turn to the right one.

### Agenda for the 1-1

    - If they cannot think of any work then for next time they will have thought about this.
6. Do you feel we’re helping you advance your career at a pace you would like?
7. What’s one thing we could do today to help you with your long term goals?
    - If they cannot answer this then this will be something they will think about until the next session.
    - If they can think about one or two things then they we will talk about actions and what done means and then next time present what they have done and the result

## Purpose Of Third Meeting
After talking about their past to understand how they got where they are today and we know where they see themselves in the future. It is time to take action. To start building the path to that future. This is done one step at the time and every journey starts with the first step. Have a read through of the

First, it is your responsibility to have them and make it their (your employees) meeting. Second, this is not a status meeting. There are plenty of opportunities to talk about project statuses elsewhere. However, the 1-1 should be about the employee. The 1-1 should have an agenda. This allows the employees to know what you want to discuss and the employee will also be able to prepare himself before the meeting. Try to keep it between 30 to 60 minutes. LightHouse has plenty on this topic and some of my favorites are the following:

## Notes
When adding the agenda to the meeting invite then do not add the indented bullet points. These bullet points are for you to do follow up questions on the question at hand and dig deeper. 

Make sure to take note in order to keep track on what has been said and different action items.


# The agenda
* How often do you want to have these 1-1s with me?
   - Enough to be asked at the first 1-1 and the follow up on the frequency every once in a while.

- - -
**Should always be at the end of each 1-1**
* Is there anything that I can help you with or do you need anything from me?
* What can I hold you accountable for next time we talk?
   - Bring at least 1 topic for the next 1-1. This is to get the employee into the habit of bringing topics to the 1-1's. These should be things that they want to discuss with you.
* What can I be accountable to you for the next time we talk?

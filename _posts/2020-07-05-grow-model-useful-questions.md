GROW is an acronym for **G**oal, **R**eality, **O**ptions and **W**ill. GROW is a model for coaching people by and provides a method for setting goals. Read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GROW_model). 

The idea of coaching is to ask open questions and let the person you are coaching to find the answers themselves. A coaching session can turn into a mentoring session.

In short the idea is to start with the end goal in mind. The goal should be as specific as possible. To help with this the [SMART method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) is helpful. The goal needs to come from the person itself. The coach should support in making it as SMART as possible. After the goal is established it is time to discover where we are today. What is the current reality? How far from the goal are we? The next thing to do is to identify the obstacles and explore what our options are to tackle them. The last thing to is define the first action item and to find out the commitment to follow through on this. If the will is to low then try to find another goal that is more important. If there is no will it won't happen. 

## Goal
* What would you like to talk about?
* What would you like to achieve?
* What will it be like when the issue is resolved?
* What would you like to be different when...
* What would you like to happen that is not happening now, or vice versa
* What outcome would you like from this discussion?
* How will you know that you have achieved that goal?

## Reality
* What is actually happening now?
* What effect does this have?
* How do you know that this is accurate?
* What is the perception of the situation?
* What have you tried so far?
* What other factors are relevant?
* What are the major constraints to finding a way forward?
* What stops you from achieving your goal?
* Have you been in a similar situation before? What worked then?
* What skills and knowledge do you need to sort this?

## Options/Obstacles
* What could you do to change the situation?
* What options do you have? Any other option?
* What alternatives are there to that approach?
* What is a quick win?
* Who might be able to help?
* Which options do you like the most?
* What are the benefits and pitfalls of these options?
* What would happen if you did nothing?

## Will/Way Forward
* What will you do?
* Will that action achieve your goal?
* What specific steps would you take next?
* When will you do this?
* What support do you need?
* On a scale 1-10, how certain are you that you will do this? What would bring this to a *higher score*?

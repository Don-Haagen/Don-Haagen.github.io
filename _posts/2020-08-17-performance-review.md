summary: Doing a performance review what to keep in mind

This post is a continuation of the [performance management post]({% link _posts/2020-08-12-performance-management.md %}). This post will dig deeper in the *performance review* topic.

## Why are we doing them?
We do them to evaluate performance and to identify high and low performers. Performance review is a serious thing and should be done properly. A good performance framework and showing the employees that this is important stuff can:
* Decrease turnover
* Increase job satisfaction
* Grow people

If your organization performance framework is not the best you can always do it right for your employees by taking it seriously.

## Perspectives
There are three perspectives that we need to understand. None of them are right or wrong. It is just three different ways to look at performance reviews.
 
### Company perspective
This might sound strange... The company do not care about all this. They want to know two things
1. Who are high performers?
2. Who are low performers?

From a company perspective they want to retain and reward the high performers and to get rid of low performers. This might sound harsh, but would you like to reward people if they are not that good at their job? The company will never be able to make everyone happy. Therefore, they focus on making the high performers happy.

### Employee perspective
For the employees this is about their own growth and career. This is important for them (most people). Therefore, this is important for you as a manager. However, most employees do not know how to do it. Which gives you an opportunity to coach them on how to do it. 

This is how the employee should do their performance review.
1. Do it seriously
2. Be based on facts with clear evidence. The employee should show with facts and evidence the claims he is doing. Just saying *"I'm the best"* is not enough. He needs to provide the facts showing why he is *"the best"*
3. Show the aspirations. Without any aspirations the employee will stagnate in his career, resulting in mediocracy. Usually there is a comment section where this can be addressed
4. A score

### Manager perspective
As a manager this is one of your most important tasks. Most of your employees takes this seriously and so must you, no matter what. Always. If you do, you will gain respect, trust and goodwill. Remember that people usually do not leave companies they <ins>leave managers</ins>. 

#### How to do it
you need to create a journal for each employee. This journal should contain
* Successes
* Failures
* Dates and links to the evidence for the two above

You should never base your assessment on opinions. Everyone is entitled to their opinion and if they disagree with yours, you can't do anything about it. However, if you base your assessment on facts and can provide evidence for it then it is not an opinion anymore. Therefore, you need to provide evidence for each and every single thing that you say about their performance.

Performance reviews usually contains predefined areas to which the employee will be graded towards. As a manager you cannot leave any question unattended. It is not an excuse for you if one of your employees do not take this seriously. You must do all this no matter what.

Where should you look for data?
* Anywhere and everywhere!
* Ask others for feedback about the employee
* Review completed projects. Who did what?
* E-mails
* Chat tools. Be mindful of only save from public channels otherwise your trust will be lost.

In short as a manager you have to:
1. Record/Register results of each employee
2. Being thorough with the documentation
3. Acknowledge the aspirations from the employee
4. Provide feedback on how to act to reach their aspirations
5. Push for more excellence
6. Provide a score
